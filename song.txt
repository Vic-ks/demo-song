I wear women's underwear
And then I go to strike a pose in my full length mirror
I cross my legs just like a queer
But my libido is strong when a lady is near, ya
What defines a straight man's straight?
Is it the boxer in the briefs or a 12 ounce steak?
I tell you what a women loves most
It's a man who can slap but can also stroke

Goin' in the wind is an eddy of the truth and it's naked
It's verbatim and it's shakin'
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no more gettin' elated
No more listless invitations

I live by a hospital
And every day I go out walking past it's sickly windows
I see people dying there
But my tender age makes it hard to care
Incinerator and a big smoke stack
It's a phallic symbol and it makes me laugh
All I need is a heart attack
C'mon, humble my bones with a Cardiac
